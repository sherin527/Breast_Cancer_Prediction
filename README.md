# Breast_Cancer_Prediction
In this, I have been used 3 models to predict the presence of breast cancerous cells in females.

1) Linear regression model:Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm which is based on supervised learning. 
It performs a regression task and  target prediction value based on independent variables.
It performs the task to predict a dependent variable value (y) based on a given independent variable (x).

2)Decision Tree model:A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure in which each internal node represents a test on a feature (e.g. whether a coin flip comes up heads or tails) ,
each leaf node represents a class label (decision taken after computing all features) and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels. 
The paths from root to leaf represent classification rules.

3)Random forest :Random forest is a supervised learning algorithm.
The "forest" it builds, is an ensemble of decision trees, usually trained with the “bagging” method. 
The general idea of the bagging method is that a combination of learning models increases the overall result.
